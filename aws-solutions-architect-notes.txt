iam - identity access management
iot - internet of things

global infrastructure
availability zone is a data center. its a facility where there are servers, SANs, switches, load balancer, etc. several data centers that are close together can be a single availability zone. perhaps a few miles within each others. 

a region is a geographical area that contains two or more availability zones. london, oregon, sydeny, tokyo etc. 

edge locations are end points for aws which are used for caching content. typically this consists of cloudfront, amazon's CDN (content delivery network). there are always more edge locations than regions. 

route 53 is amazon's dns service

vpc is virtual private cloud - virtual data center

identity access management 101
-------------------------------

iam allows you to manage users and the level of access to the aws console. 

- centralized control of your aws account
- shared access to your aws account
- granualar permissions
- identity federation (active directory, facebook etc.)
- multifactor authentication
- provides temporary access where necessary
- allows setting up password rotation policy
- integrates with many different aws services
- supports pci dss compliance

key terminology
- users
- groups
- policies (made of documents, and these documents are in json format)
- roles

what is the root account - this is the account that is used to sign up for aws. this has god mode access. 

- iam is universal. it does not apply to regions
- root account is the account created when setting up the aws account. it has complete admin access
- new users have no permissions when first created
	created an administrator access policy
	created developers group
- new users are assigned access key id and secret access key when first created
- different types of access - console access, programmatic access
- user access key id and secret keys are not the same as password. user access key id and secret keys cannot be used to access the console. they can be used to access aws via apis and command line
- always setup mfa on root account

s3 101
------

one of the oldest and most important services for the exam

s3 = simple storage service


- safe place to store files
- oject based storage i.e they can be uploaded & files can be between 0 - 5tb in size. 
- data is spread across multiple facilities
- buckets must be unique in name, because they exist in the global namespace
ex - https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<somename>
- when you upload a file to s3, an http 200 code is received
- objects consist of - key (name), value (data of the file), version id, metadata, sub resources (access control list, torrents)

how is data consistency achieved
- read after write consistency for PUTS and new objects. if you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data. 
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate). if you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version or maybe not. it might take some time to propagate the change. 

s3 - guarantees
- built for 99.99% availability for the s3 platform
- amazon will guarantee 99.9% availability
- amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability (99. eleven 9s)

s3 - features

- tiered storage (different storage classes)
- lifecycle management (moving between different tiers)
- versioning
- encryption
- mfa for deleting delete
- secure data using access control list and bucket policies
- stored redundant across multiple devices and multiple devices

s3 storage classes

- s3 standard
	99.99% availability
	99. (eleven 9s) durability
	stored across multiple devices in multiple locations
	designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities

s3 - ia (infrequently accessed)
	accessed less frequently and requires rapid access when accessed. charged retrieval fee

s3 one zone - ia
	low cost option for infrequently accessed data

s3 intelligent tiering
	uses machine learning to determine the tier, and moves it around different storage classes

s3 glacier
	secure low cost storage for data archiving
	retrieval times are configurable from minutes to hours

s3 glacier deep archive
	low cost storage where retrieval times of 12 hours is acceptable. this is the lowest cost of storage you can buy. 
	
s3 charges
	storage - the more you store in s3, the more you are charged
	requests - the more you request, the more you are charged
	storage management pricing - based on the tiers that are available
	data transfer pricing - 
	transfer acceleration - enable fast transfer of data between the end users and the s3 bucket. this takes advantage of amazon's cloudfront edge locations. as data arrives to the edge location, it is routed to amazon s3 over an optimized network path. 
	cross region replication pricing - if a bucket is in one region (us west) to another (sydney) and if cross region replication is turned on, then this data is replicated across these regions, and it costs to do so. 

exam tips for s3
	s3 is object based. i.e. it allows file upload
	files can be 0 bytes to 5TB
	there is unlimited storage
	files are stored in buckets (a folder in the cloud)
	buckets should have a unique name, they are in a universal namespace
	not suitable for installing an os or db
	successful upload will result in http 200 code
	you can turn on mfa delete
	key (name) - value (sequence of bytes; data) - version id - metadata - sub resources
	consistency model - read after write for puts of new objects; eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes (can take some time to propagate)
	rrs - reduced redundency storage, which is an older synonym for ia (infrequently accessed)

s3 bucket properties that are most important for the solutions architect associate exam
	versioning
	static website hosting
	encryption
	transfer acceleration

12. s3 security and encryption
==============================
newly created buckets are private
access to the bucket can be controlled by
	bucket policies
	access control lists (acl)
s3 buckets can be configured to create access logs, these logs can be sent to another bucket, or another bucket in another account

there are different types of encryption
	encryption in transit. ex - accessing a website over https
		ssl/tls
	encryption at rest (server side), this can be achieved by -
		s3 managed keys - sse-s3 (server side encryption s3)
		aws key management service (kms), managed keys - sse-kms (server side encryption key management service)
		server side encryption with customer provided keys - sse-c
	client side encryption - encrypt the file client side, and upload it to s3

13. s3 version control
======================

versioning
	stores all versions of an object, including all writes, even if the object is deleted
	once versioning is enabled, it can only be suspended. to disable versioning, the entire bucket has to be deleted.
	integrates with lifecycle rules
	versioning comes with mfa delete capability
	
14. lifecycle management with s3
================================

lifecycle rules manage objects by automating transition to tiered storage. 
can be used in conjunction with versioning. does not need versioning enabled.
it can be applied to current versions and previous versions


15. cross region replication
=============================

requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination buckets
files in existing bucket are not automatically replicated. 
subsequent updates will be replicated
deletes in the "primary" bucket are not replicated in the replication-bucket. 
it is also not going to replicate deleting individual versions

16. transfer acceleration
=========================

s3 transfer acceleration utilizes the cloudfront edge network to accelerate uploads to s3
instead of uploading to an s3 bucket, you can upload directly to a distinct url that will then transfer the file to s3

17. cloudfront overview
=======================

key terminology
	edge location - this is a location where contact is cached. this is separate to an aws region/az
	origin - this is the origin of all the files that the cdn will distribute 
	distribution - name that is given to the cdn which consists of a collection of edge locations
	web distribution - typically used for websites
	rtmp - used for media streaming

cloudfront can be used to deliver your contant (website (static dynamic), steaming and interactive content) using a global network of edge locations. request for the content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location so content is delivered as fast as possible

you can write to an edge location. 
objects are cached for the life of the ttl (time to live)
you can clear cached objects, but you will be charged

19. snowball
============

it is a petabyte scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of aws. 

transferring data with snowball is simple, fast, secure and can cost 1.5th of high speed internet

snowball edge comes in 100tb data transfer device with on-board storage and compute capabilities. 

snowball edge connects to your existing applications and infrastructure using standard storage interfaces. 

it can cluster together to form a local storage tier and process your data on premises, helping ensure your applications continue to run even when they are not able to access the cloud. 

snowball can import to s3, export to s3
